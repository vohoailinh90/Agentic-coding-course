# Claude → Codex Cloud via GitHub Comments

## 1. Purpose

This document defines the only approved method for Claude to delegate work to Codex Cloud:
Claude must post a GitHub Issue or Pull Request comment containing the exact ASCII mention `@codex`.

Do not use:

- OpenAI API
- Codex GitHub Action
- Codex CLI
- Codex SDK
- Browser automation against the Codex UI
- Local shell commands to start Codex

GitHub comments are the shared communication channel between Claude and Codex.

## 2. Claude's responsibility

Claude is the orchestrator.

Claude must:

1. Inspect the repository and current task.
2. Determine the correct Codex task mode.
3. Create a precise task contract.
4. Choose the correct GitHub Issue or Pull Request.
5. Check that the same task has not already been posted.
6. Post one GitHub comment beginning with `@codex`.
7. Record the task ID, mode and exact commit SHA — except for a built-in command (review, security review, merge), which has no task ID: record `task_id: null` per sections 5/6/14 instead.
8. Stop and wait for Codex Cloud to respond.
9. Inspect Codex's response or implementation.
10. Request corrections only when supported by concrete evidence.

Claude must actually post the GitHub comment when GitHub write capability is available. Claude must not merely draft a comment and claim that Codex was called.

## 3. Correct `@codex` syntax

Claude must use the normal ASCII character:

```text
@codex
```

Do not use similar Unicode characters:

```text
＠codex
```

Do not place spaces inside the mention:

```text
@ codex
```

For code review, use the exact trigger:

```text
@codex review
```

For security review, use:

```text
@codex security review
```

For other tasks, start the comment with:

```text
@codex
```

Then provide the complete task instructions underneath.

**When posting any comment or reply on GitHub — as opposed to writing in this file, which GitHub does not scan — never include a literal `@codex ...` trigger string except in the one intentional comment meant to invoke it.** The GitHub connector matches the mention wherever it appears in a posted comment, not only at the start, so quoting the exact syntax to explain or refer to it (even inside backticks, even in a reply on a review thread) can re-trigger Codex with malformed or empty arguments. When a GitHub comment needs to refer to the syntax without invoking it, break it so it cannot match — e.g. write `@`+`codex review` or "the codex review command" — rather than the literal unbroken string. This file's own template blocks (sections 3, 7-13) are unaffected: they exist to be copied into the one intentional trigger comment, not posted as-is alongside other text.

## 4. Selecting the correct GitHub location

Use a GitHub Issue for

- Architecture brainstorming
- Repository-wide audit
- New feature implementation
- Bug implementation when no PR exists
- Investigation and root-cause analysis
- Creating a new implementation branch

Use a Pull Request for

- Reviewing the current PR diff
- Auditing an implementation
- Fixing review findings
- Fixing CI failures
- Requesting changes on the current PR branch
- Final code review

Claude must not open a new Issue when an existing Issue already represents the same task.
Claude must not post an implementation request into an unrelated Pull Request.

## 5. Required task contract

Every Codex request, except the exact built-in commands (review, security review, merge — see sections 11, 12, and 20), must contain this contract:

```yaml
task_id: "<unique-task-id>"
mode: "BRAINSTORM | INVESTIGATE | AUDIT | IMPLEMENT | FIX"
repository: "<owner/repository>"
base_branch: "<base-branch>"
target_branch: "<branch-or-null>"
target_sha: "<exact-commit-sha>"

goal: >
  A single clear description of the expected result.

scope:
  - Approved component, directory or behavior

out_of_scope:
  - Unrelated changes
  - Unapproved refactoring
  - Production deployment

write_policy: "none | current_pr_branch | feature_branch_only"

constraints:
  - Preserve existing behavior outside the approved scope.
  - Do not expose secrets.
  - Do not use destructive Git commands.

acceptance_criteria:
  - An objectively verifiable condition
  - Another objectively verifiable condition

required_output:
  - Summary
  - Evidence
  - Changed files, if applicable
  - Tests performed
  - Remaining risks
  - Recommended next action
```

Claude must resolve and include the actual commit SHA. Do not use placeholders such as `latest`, `current` or `HEAD` in a posted task.

## 6. Comment tracking

Every Claude comment that triggers Codex with a task contract (sections 7-10, 13) must end with this tracking marker:

```html
<!--
claude-codex-task
task_id: SI-0042
mode: BRAINSTORM
target_sha: a17d90c123456789
round: 1
-->
```

The built-in commands (`@codex review`, `@codex review for ...`, `@codex security review` — section 11-12; `@codex merge this pull request` — section 20) are exempt from this marker: the review forms must be posted as the exact command shown, with nothing appended, and the merge form as the exact prefix followed only by the branch/status lines section 20 specifies — a marker cannot be attached without breaking the trigger. Their duplicate check and identity tracking instead come from the PR head SHA and from Codex's own response, which reports the exact commit it acted on (`Reviewed commit: <sha>` for a review, the merge commit SHA for a merge) — see section 11's SHA-change rule.

Before posting, Claude must search the existing Issue or PR comments for the same combination:

```text
task_id + mode + target_sha + round
```

If that combination already exists, Claude must not post the request again.

## 7. Brainstorm request

Use a GitHub Issue unless the discussion belongs to an existing PR.

```

## 11. Pull Request review

For a standard Codex code review, Claude must post this exact command in the Pull Request:

```text
@codex review
```

For a focused review:

```text
@codex review for functional regressions, DMC-to-source-image
tracking errors, Excel corruption, unsafe file handling and violations
of the acceptance criteria in Issue #42.
```

Claude must request a new review only when:

- The PR head SHA has changed; or
- The previous Codex review failed to run.

Claude must not request repeated reviews for the same PR head SHA.

## 12. Security review

When a security-specific review is required, post this exact comment in the Pull Request:

```text
@codex security review
```

Do not replace this with a generic audit prompt when the purpose is specifically Codex Security Review.

## 13. Fixing a confirmed finding

Use the existing Pull Request containing the problem.

```text
@codex

MODE: FIX

Fix the confirmed P1 finding described in the review above.

Task contract:

task_id: SI-0045-FIX-01
mode: FIX
repository: vohoailinh90/Shipping_Inspection
base_branch: main
target_branch: "<current-pr-branch>"
target_sha: "<current-pr-head-sha>"

goal: >
  Fix the confirmed P1 finding described in the review above.

scope:
  - The file(s) and behavior named in the confirmed finding

out_of_scope:

round: 1
-->
```

Claude must not ask Codex to fix a speculative finding. Confirm the finding first.

## 14. Validating Codex's response

Claude must not accept Codex's summary without inspecting the actual GitHub state.

After Codex responds, Claude must:

1. Confirm that the response belongs to the correct Issue or PR.
2. Confirm the task ID and task mode. For a built-in command response, there is no `task_id` (section 6/14 exempt it); confirm the mode (`REVIEW`, `SECURITY_REVIEW`, or `MERGE`) instead.
3. Confirm the SHA reviewed or modified by Codex.
4. Inspect the current PR head SHA. Two cases have no PR to inspect:
   - Read-only Issue request (BRAINSTORM, INVESTIGATE, AUDIT — `write_policy: none`): inspect the current head of `base_branch` instead and use that as `current_sha`.
   - IMPLEMENT that pushed a branch but did not open a PR (section 10 makes the PR link optional): inspect the current head of `target_branch` instead and use that as `current_sha`.
5. Inspect the complete diff.
6. Check every acceptance criterion separately.
7. Check for unrelated changes.
8. Verify reported test evidence.
9. Report unresolved risks.
10. Decide the next state.

Claude's verification output must use:

```yaml
task_id: "<task-id>"
codex_mode: "<mode>"
requested_sha: "<requested-sha>"
reported_sha: "<sha-codex-reported-producing, or null when not applicable>"
current_sha: "<current-sha>"
status: "ACCEPTED | CHANGES_REQUIRED | BLOCKED | STALE"
unresolved_findings: []
next_action: "<single-next-action>"
```

`requested_sha` is always the starting point given in the request (the SHA Codex was told to read from or build on) — it is not necessarily what the final result should match. `reported_sha` is the commit SHA Codex's own response says it produced (e.g. its "Commit SHA" line, or the merge commit SHA for a MERGE response); it applies to IMPLEMENT, FIX, and MERGE, and is `null` for everything else.

The `STALE` check compares against different things depending on the mode, because `requested_sha` means different things for read-only vs. mutating modes:

- REVIEW, SECURITY_REVIEW, and the read-only modes (BRAINSTORM, INVESTIGATE, AUDIT): `requested_sha` is the exact commit Codex looked at. Use `STALE` whenever `current_sha` (the `base_branch` head for an Issue-based read-only request, or the PR head otherwise) simply does not equal `requested_sha` — a reset, rebase, or force-push can move the head to a divergent commit that isn't a descendant, so a plain inequality catches that too, not only forward movement.
- IMPLEMENT and FIX: `requested_sha` is only the starting base commit — comparing it to `current_sha` is meaningless, since a successful run necessarily advances the branch past it. Instead use `STALE` whenever `current_sha` (the `target_branch` head — PR head if one exists, else the branch head per section 10) simply does not equal `reported_sha` — not only when it has moved further ahead. A reset, rebase, or force-push can replace `reported_sha` with a divergent commit that isn't its descendant, so an ancestry/"moved past" check alone would miss that the reported output no longer exists at the branch head; a plain inequality catches every case where the branch no longer points at what Codex reported producing. Confirming `requested_sha` was a valid starting point is a separate check (step 3), not part of the `STALE` decision.
- MERGE: does not use `STALE` at all — a completed merge is a terminal event, not something that becomes outdated the way a live branch head does. Instead: `current_sha` is the PR's actual `merge_commit_sha` on GitHub (present only once GitHub shows the PR as merged); `reported_sha` is the merge commit SHA Codex's response reports. Two things must both hold: `current_sha` equals `reported_sha`, and the PR's recorded head SHA immediately before merge equals the `validated_head_sha` from section 20 (i.e. the merge commit's non-base parent, or the PR's `head.sha`) — confirming the merge landed the exact validated content, not a head that moved after validation but before the merge executed. If either does not hold, this does not validate — use `CHANGES_REQUIRED` (Codex reported success but the merge commit or merged head doesn't match) or `BLOCKED` (the PR shows no merge at all), never `STALE`.

For a built-in command response (`@codex review`, `@codex review for ...`, `@codex security review`, or `@codex merge this pull request`), which section 6 exempts from carrying a `task_id`: set `task_id: null` and `codex_mode: "REVIEW"`, `"SECURITY_REVIEW"`, or `"MERGE"`. For REVIEW/SECURITY_REVIEW, establish identity from `requested_sha`/`current_sha` alone (matching Codex's own "Reviewed commit" line). For MERGE, establish identity from `reported_sha`/`current_sha` as defined above.

## 15. State labels

Use these GitHub labels when available:

```text
ai:needs-codex-brainstorm
ai:waiting-for-codex
ai:codex-complete
ai:ready-for-implementation
ai:implementation-in-progress
ai:needs-codex-review
ai:changes-required
ai:approved
ai:blocked
```

Expected lifecycle:

```text
ai:needs-codex-brainstorm
    -> ai:waiting-for-codex
    -> ai:codex-complete
    -> ai:ready-for-implementation
    -> ai:implementation-in-progress
    -> ai:needs-codex-review
    -> ai:approved
```

After Claude posts an `@codex` comment:

1. Remove the label that requested the trigger.
2. Add `ai:waiting-for-codex`.
3. Do not post another Codex request while this label remains — except the single authorized built-in-command retry (sections 16-17, including MERGE) when the first attempt produced a trigger failure; posting it does not require removing or changing this label first.
4. When Codex completes, replace it with the appropriate next label.

## 16. Preventing duplicate calls and infinite loops

Claude must follow these rules:

- Maximum brainstorm rounds: `2`
- Maximum correction rounds: `2`
- Only one active Codex request per Issue or PR
- Never trigger the same task mode twice for the same SHA, with two documented exceptions:
  - a built-in command (review or merge) that ends in a trigger failure (section 17: no response, or an explicit error/rate-limit message instead of the expected output) on an unchanged PR head, as sections 11 and 20 authorize — at most once per SHA; if the retry itself also ends in a trigger failure, do not retry again: follow section 17 step 2 instead; or
  - a validated correction round, within the round limits above, on an unchanged SHA for a read-only request (BRAINSTORM, INVESTIGATE, AUDIT — `write_policy: none`), whether posted on an Issue or a PR (section 7 allows BRAINSTORM on either) — nothing moves the SHA between rounds when nothing else touches it, so a correction round necessarily re-triggers the same mode on the same SHA, and is only allowed after Claude has validated the prior response per section 14
- Never respond to a Codex comment by immediately posting another `@codex` request without first validating the result
- Never let a bot comment automatically create an unrestricted bot-to-bot loop
- Stop when business judgment or human authorization is required
- Escalate unresolved P0 and P1 disagreements to the repository owner

Claude must never use repeated `@codex` comments to test whether the integration is working.

## 17. Confirming that Codex was triggered

Claude must not claim that Codex was successfully called merely because the comment was submitted.

Successful trigger evidence is at least one of:

- Codex reacts to the comment
- The `chatgpt-codex-connector` bot responds with a review or a linked task
- A linked Codex Cloud task appears
- Codex posts a review

A **trigger failure** is either of:

- No evidence appears at all after waiting at least 10 minutes since the comment was posted, with no further evidence arriving in that window (via a live PR-activity subscription/notification where available, or a manual re-check otherwise) — Codex reviews normally respond within a few minutes, so this window is meant to rule out a delayed-but-still-running review, not to force a fixed delay when evidence already arrived sooner; or
- The bot responds, but with an explicit error or rate-limit message instead of a review or task link (e.g. a usage-limit notice) — the bot did respond, but the trigger still did not produce usable output.

This 10-minute wait applies only to the no-evidence-at-all case above. Do not post the retry before that wait has elapsed with no evidence — posting early risks a duplicate review landing once the first one completes, breaking the "one active request" rule in section 16. An explicit error/rate-limit response is itself immediate evidence of a trigger failure and needs no wait: proceed straight to the retry.

A third case is neither of these: Codex acknowledges the trigger (reacts, or a linked task appears) but the task does not produce the mode's expected final output — a review for any built-in review command (`@codex review`, `@codex review for ...`, `@codex security review`), a merged PR with a reported merge commit SHA for `@codex merge this pull request`, or the `required_output` report described in sections 7-10/13 for every other mode. A valid final response in that expected shape is success, whatever the mode; only its absence is a problem. This is an **unsuccessful completion**, not a trigger failure — the trigger worked, so the review retry below does not apply (retrying would risk a second concurrent Codex run against the same request). It covers two shapes:

- **Stalled**: no final response of the expected shape arrives within a reasonable time (a further 30+ minutes with no update after the acknowledgement).
- **Terminal failure**: the linked task itself later posts an explicit failure, error, or cancellation instead of its expected output.

Either shape: do not post another `@codex` comment; set the task status to `BLOCKED` with `next_action` describing the stall or the reported failure; and report it to the repository owner.

On a trigger failure:

1. If this is a built-in command (`@codex review`, `@codex review for ...`, `@codex security review`, or `@codex merge this pull request`) and no retry has been posted yet for this SHA, post the single authorized retry per sections 11/20/16 — the `ai:waiting-for-codex` label, if present, does not block this (section 15) — then wait for a response before doing anything else. Do not post a second retry.
2. Otherwise — this was not a built-in command, or the one authorized retry also ended in a trigger failure — do not post any further duplicate comments, and instead:
   1. Confirm that the exact ASCII mention `@codex` was used.
   2. Confirm that Codex Cloud is enabled for the repository.
   3. Confirm that the repository is accessible to the Codex GitHub integration.
   4. Confirm that the triggering GitHub identity is authorized.
   5. Set the task status to `BLOCKED`.
   6. Report the failure to the repository owner.

Do not use API, Codex Action, CLI or SDK as a fallback.

## 18. Codex account routing

Claude cannot select a Codex account through comment text.

The following instruction has no routing effect:

```text
@codex use account number 2
```

GitHub and the Codex integration determine which linked account and quota apply.

If the wrong Codex account is being used, Claude must:

1. Stop posting new Codex comments.
2. Mark the task `ai:blocked`.
3. Report that the GitHub-to-Codex account linkage must be corrected by the repository owner.

Claude must not attempt to solve account routing by posting additional mentions.

## 19. Safety rules

Claude must never ask Codex to:

- Push directly to `main`
- Force-push
- Delete branches or repository history
- Reveal secrets
- Modify production credentials
- Disable branch protection
- Bypass required reviews
- Execute unrelated refactoring
- Expand the approved scope silently

Merging a pull request is authorized once the completion criteria in section 20 are met — that section defines how and when, including how to ask Codex to perform the merge itself.

Implementation requests must always include:

```text
Work only on the approved branch.
Preserve unrelated behavior.
Report all changed files and tests.
```

## 20. Definition of done, and autonomous merge authority

A Claude-to-Codex task is complete only when:

- The `@codex` trigger produced verifiable evidence.
- Codex processed the intended Issue or PR.
- Codex used the intended task mode.
- Codex referenced or modified the correct SHA.
- Claude inspected the actual response or diff.
- Acceptance criteria have evidence.
- Relevant tests passed, and every repository-required check and review on the PR is green — not only Claude's own ad hoc test run.
- No unresolved P0 or P1 finding remains.
- No unauthorized scope expansion occurred.

When all of that holds, record the exact PR head SHA that was validated as `validated_head_sha`, and the base branch's head SHA at that same moment as `validated_base_sha`.

Once a task meets that definition, Claude is authorized to merge the pull request without waiting for a human — this applies uniformly, including to irreversible, destructive, security, and payment-shaped changes. But time passes between validating a head and executing the merge, and either side can move in that gap: a new commit or force-push on the PR branch, or new commits landing on the base branch. GitHub merges the PR head into whatever the base branch currently is at merge time, not the base branch as it was when the checks ran — so an advanced base can land an unvalidated combination even when the PR head itself is still exactly `validated_head_sha`, and every recorded check still refers to the old state either way.

The head side has an atomic guard: GitHub's merge API takes an expected-head-SHA parameter and fails closed if the PR head has moved (section 20's merge calls below use it). **The base side has no equivalent parameter** — nothing turns a "check the base, then merge" sequence into one atomic operation, so no amount of re-checking immediately before merging closes that gap; a base-branch commit landing between the check and the merge call is a real race no matter how short the window.

Because of that, autonomous merge on a repository requires branch protection's "require branches to be up to date before merging," or an equivalent merge queue, enabled on the base branch — confirm this before ever attempting an autonomous merge on that repository. With it enabled, GitHub itself atomically rejects the merge if the base has advanced past what the PR branch was validated against, the same way the expected-head-SHA parameter does for the head.

The rule being enabled is not enough by itself — it must also actually bind whichever identity will execute the merge. GitHub offers more than one way to exempt an actor from a branch rule, and this list is illustrative, not exhaustive — treat it as "confirm no bypass mechanism applies to this identity," not as a fixed checklist to clear: classic branch protection's "include administrators" toggle, a classic protection custom role granted the "bypass branch protections" repository permission, a ruleset's explicit bypass list, and organization-owner or app-installation privileges that sit above repository-level rules entirely. Before picking a merge path (direct or delegated to Codex, per step 3 below), confirm that the identity that path would actually use has no route around the rule by any mechanism the repository's configuration provides — check only the identity for the path being considered, not both; the one never used for this merge is irrelevant to it.

If the rule isn't enabled, or the merging identity can bypass it, autonomous merge is not safe on that repository: this is a blocker (the "genuine blocker" case below) — escalate to the repository owner to enable it, remove the bypass, or merge manually, rather than attempting a manual pre-check that cannot be made atomic.

With that precondition confirmed, close the head-side gap immediately before merging, with nothing else done in between:

1. Re-fetch the PR's current head SHA and confirm it still equals `validated_head_sha`, and the base branch's current head SHA and confirm it still equals `validated_base_sha`.
2. If either does not match, do not merge. Treat this as `STALE`.
   - If only the PR head moved: the new head has not been validated. Re-run the definition-of-done checks against it before considering a merge again.
   - If the base branch moved: merge the current base into the PR branch and re-run the definition-of-done checks against the result before recording fresh `validated_head_sha`/`validated_base_sha` and merging — merging the base in cleanly is not by itself proof the combination is safe.
3. Only once both are confirmed unchanged, merge — do either:

   - Merge directly, using Claude's own GitHub write access, with the merge call itself scoped to `validated_head_sha` so it fails closed if the head has moved since step 1; or
   - Ask Codex to merge it: `@codex merge this pull request` is a third built-in command, alongside review and security review — exempt from the task contract (section 5) and the tracking marker (section 6) the same way, and posted the same way: the exact prefix below with nothing preceding it, then the branch details, the exact validated head SHA, and status on the following lines. Checking the head and then merging is not enough — a change can still land in the gap between Codex's check and its merge call. The request must instruct Codex to pass that expected SHA to the merge operation itself (GitHub's merge API accepts an expected head SHA and atomically rejects the merge if the PR's actual head no longer matches, rather than merging and reporting a mismatch after the fact), not merge first and validate after. Its response must report the commit it actually merged, so Claude can verify it against `validated_head_sha` per section 14's MERGE rule.

     ```text
     @codex merge this pull request

     Branch: `<branch>` into `<base_branch>`.
     Expected head: `<validated_head_sha>` — pass this as the expected head SHA to the merge call itself, not as a manual pre-check, so the merge atomically fails if the PR's actual head no longer matches.
     Status: [one line naming what made it complete, e.g. the review round and head SHA, or the validated acceptance criteria].
     ```

Record the merge commit SHA and a one-line summary of what shipped, in the same PR or Issue thread.

A human is needed only for:

- **A genuine blocker**: the task cannot reach the definition of done above without a decision only a human can make — for example two valid designs with different tradeoffs and no documented preference, an ambiguous or missing acceptance criterion, or a finding Claude cannot verify from the repository alone.
- **A change to the original requirement**: what should be built has itself changed, not just how to build it.

Escalate to the repository owner in those two cases and only those two; do not hold a completed task open waiting for a merge approval that this protocol does not require.
