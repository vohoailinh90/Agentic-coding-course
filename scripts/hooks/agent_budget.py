"""Enforce `budget.max_agent_invocations` at the moment a subagent is spawned.

The routing policy calls its ceiling "not advisory", but until now nothing
counted. This script keeps a ledger for the requirement in progress and runs as
a `PreToolUse` hook on the `Agent` tool: every spawn is charged to the base
ceiling or to a reserve that was granted for that agent, and a spawn past the
ceiling is refused with the policy's own escalation guidance. A count is
computable, so a script counts — see *Deterministic work is not agent work*
in CLAUDE.md.

The ledger is written by `scripts/route.py --record` and lives beside the
session handoff, per checkout rather than per session: a restarted session
resumes the same requirement's budget, and a new requirement re-records.

Hook subcommands (read the hook payload on stdin, fail open):

    pre-tool-use    PreToolUse (matcher: Agent)   charge the spawn, or deny it
    session-start   SessionStart                  replay the ledger's state

Manual subcommands:

    status                    show the ledger
    grant RESERVE [--agent A] grant a runtime reserve (escalation_reserve after
                              the reviewer formally escalated)
    charge --agent A          count an invocation the hook could not see, such
                              as a resumed critique round
    reset                     remove the ledger

Re-recording a route for the same requirement (same `--requirement` label, or
no label on either side) carries the charges already made into the new
ledger, so the hook's own advice — re-classify when the requirement grew —
cannot reopen the budget. Only `route.py --record --fresh`, a different
label, or `reset` starts from zero.

Set CLAUDE_AGENT_BUDGET_UNROUTED=deny to refuse spawns when no ledger exists;
by default they are allowed, uncounted, with a nudge to classify first.
